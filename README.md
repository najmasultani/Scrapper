## Project Info

**Live Project**: [Lovable AI Compost Search](https://lovable.dev/projects/a85ae806-c5b6-4d2e-98b5-7cfbf0b84b51)

This is a prompt-engineering-driven web application designed to enhance compost reuse by enabling users to perform AI-powered natural language searches for compost listings. The project leverages Gemini AI to make eco-friendly resource sharing easier and more intuitive.

## AI-Powered Search Feature

This project includes an intelligent search feature powered by Google's Gemini AI that allows users to search compost listings using natural language queries.

### Features:
- **Natural Language Search**: Search using phrases like "coffee grounds for my vegetable garden" or "organic waste near restaurants"
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Get intelligent search suggestions based on your input
- **Relevance Scoring**: Results are ranked by AI-determined relevance with explanations
- **Real-time Search**: Debounced search with instant results as you type

### Setup:

1. **Get a Gemini API Key**:
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key for Gemini
   - Copy the API key

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your Gemini API key:
     ```
     ```

3. **Security Note**: 
   - Never commit your actual API key to version control
   - The API key will be visible in the client-side code, so consider implementing a backend proxy for production use
   - For development and demo purposes, the current setup is sufficient

### Usage:
- Navigate to the "Browse Compost Listings" page
- Use the search bar at the top to enter natural language queries
- Click on AI-generated suggestions for quick searches
- View relevance scores and explanations for search results
